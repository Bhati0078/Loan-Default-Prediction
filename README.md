# Loan-Default-Prediction
**Description:**
The Loan Default Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can effectively identify borrowers at risk of defaulting on their loans. This is crucial for financial institutions to minimize potential losses and make informed lending decisions. The project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes of borrowers, such as credit score (FICO), purpose of the loan, interest rate, and credit policy status, among others.

**Data Preprocessing:**
The project begins with data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and class imbalance issues.

**Feature Engineering:**
Feature engineering techniques are applied to extract meaningful information from the dataset. This may involve creating new features, transforming existing ones, or selecting relevant features using correlation analysis and domain knowledge.

**Model Development:**
The project implements several machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models for loan default prediction. Initially, a Decision Tree Classifier is trained and tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize the hyperparameters. The trained model is visualized to gain insights into the decision-making process.

**Model Evaluation:**
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's effectiveness in predicting loan defaults.

**Model Comparison:**
In addition to the Decision Tree Classifier, other ensemble learning algorithms such as Bagging, AdaBoost, RandomForest, and GradientBoosting are implemented and evaluated. This allows for a comparison of different models and their performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.

**Conclusion:**
The Loan Default Prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in financial risk assessment. By leveraging predictive modeling, financial institutions can enhance their decision-making process and mitigate the impact of loan defaults. The project code and documentation on GitHub serve as valuable resources for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in the field of credit risk analysis and predictive modeling.
